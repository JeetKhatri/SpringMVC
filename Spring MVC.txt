Spring MVC :-
-	Spring MVC is web application development framework based on MVC guidelines.	
-	user request for webpage then that request received by front controller.(DispatcherServlet)
-	front controller who controls the complete application flow.
-	Job of front controller is to prepare and send the response to the client.
-	See image mvc.jpg
-	As per image, all the incoming request is handle by the DispatcherServlet that works as the front controller. 
-	The DispatcherServlet gets entry of handler mapping from the xml file and forwards the request to the controller.
-	The controller returns an object of ModelAndView. 
-	The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of view resolver in the xml file and invokes the specified view component.


To write it follow 4 steps :-
-	Modify web.xml file 
-	create spring's xml
-	Controller
-	view

Annotation :-
-	If we use annotation then we do not to write entry in xml.
-	for controller use annotation @controller
-	when we call for welcome and for that link we have to use @RequestMapping("welcome") because we didn't write it in xml
